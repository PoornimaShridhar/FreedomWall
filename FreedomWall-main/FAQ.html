            <h3 class="accordion"><img src="gallery/shoe.png" style="width:40px;height:35px;margin-right:5px;"></img>Who can climb?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a body, you can climb. Young, old, weak and strong - the tags fall flat when it comes to climbing. Because, very literally, anybody can climb.</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3 class="accordion"><img src="gallery/shoe.png" style="width:40px;height:35px;margin-right:5px;"></img>What climbing can do to you?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Everytime you climb, you change a little. The body is changing itself itself to do more and be more. Mentally, it equips you to develop your thinking capabilities. Strength, flexibility,, endurance are all by-products. </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="accordion"><img src="gallery/shoe.png" style="width:40px;height:35px;margin-right:5px;"></img>Climbing vs other sport</h3>
            <div class="panel">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Climbing teaches to use your being in entirety. You are not just using your wrists or your legs or your arms. You are using every bit of yourself, every minute. Your entire body is engaged and ready for the next move and the move after that. You take your mind off one part and you risk coming off the wall.  </p>

            <h3 class="accordion"><img src="gallery/shoe.png" style="width:40px;height:35px;margin-right:5px;"></img>What is it?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The name of our own new bouldering wall, in partnership with Girivihar, Mumbai’s oldest climbing club.
 
                Bouldering is a discipline of climbing where one climbs a wall that is 14 feet tall, using soft cushion mats on the ground to fall on, without injury. Girivihar organized the 2016 and 2017 World Cup bouldering competitions in Mumbai, for the first time in India. We are now fortunate to enjoy the same world-class wall, which has been relocated to our own campus- thanks to a shared vision between IITB and Girivihar to develop a climbing culture on campus and eventually in Mumbai.

            <h3 class="accordion"><img src="gallery/shoe.png" style="width:40px;height:35px;margin-right:5px;"></img>Who it is for?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s an exhaustive list:
                <ul style="text-align: justify;">
                <li>Kids</li>      
                <li>Grandparents</li>    
                <li>20-something hardcore athletes with six-pack abs (8-packs allowed too!)</li>    
                 <li>Soft-core athletes who can’t touch their toes</li>    
                <li>In short anyone with an urge to climb, try something new</li>    
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Climbing is not for the elite alone, it is for everyone on campus to enjoy together with camaraderie, that is precisely what this wall is about. Be your own hero! 
                </p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h3 class="accordion"><img src="gallery/shoe.png" style="width:40px;height:35px;margin-right:5px;"></img>Prior experience/prerequisites?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">For now, the wall will be open for anyone with a pair of climbing shoes and ability to understand and follow basic etiquette.

                Eventually we want to get to a stage where even people with physical disabilities can enjoy the sport safely; we will work on it in the next phase. What is prerequisite is a positive can-do or can-try attitude, to challenge yourself and better yourself. Remember, babies learn to climb before they can walk, climbing is a natural activity before modern life rendered it unnatural.

            <h3 class="accordion"><img src="gallery/shoe.png" style="width:40px;height:35px;margin-right:5px;"></img>So, can I just come and climb?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">No. Climbing is a fairly evolved sport and it has some norms, etiquettes, and rules to be followed. You need to attend a free Intro workshop by volunteers, where these things will be explained along with slots/schedules system. For example, it is mandatory to wear climbing shoes (special sticky rubber shoes) while climbing.

            <h3 class="accordion"><img src="gallery/shoe.png" style="width:40px;height:35px;margin-right:5px;"></img>What to do if I don’t have shoes?</h3>
            <div class="panel">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Shoes are personal items, for hygiene and form/fit issues (feet stink, more so sweaty feet!). So ideally you must invest in a pair for yourself. However, it is common for beginners to try their hand (feet) at climbing using rented/borrowed shoes before they decide to invest in their own. The volunteers have arranged a loan of several pairs as a temporary measure; you can find out details once you register for workshops.

            <h3 class="accordion"><img src="gallery/shoe.png" style="width:40px;height:35px;margin-right:5px;"></img>Where to buy shoes:</h3>
            <div class="panel">
            <p style="text-align: justify;">An entry level pair costs about 3.5k in Decathlon R City Mall; you can also get much nicer ones from abroad at similar or better prices
